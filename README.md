# EcoMaps

Uses Javascript, HTML/CSS, and Google Maps and Navigation API to build a site that provides users with a comparison of the carbon footprints left by the routes resulting from a Google Maps navigation search. Methodology built from carbon emission data released by the EPA, mode of transportation, and distance and duration information from Google Navigation. The site also facilitates donations to Carbonfund.org, allowing users to offset the carbon footprint from their travels and become more environmentally aware.
